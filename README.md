# Swordie Flaming Bot
v229 but should work on any ver
OS: Windows 10, Resolution: 1920p x 1080p

# Guide
- MUST RUN SCRIPT AS ADMINSTRATOR !!! (important)
- Make game window windowed and smaller than resolution
- Prepare a large batch of flames and use one flame on the desired item to open up the flaming window
- Run the script and enter in desired stats (currently you are forced to enter in 2 stats

# Warnings
- Do not move the maplestory window after the program has started
- Do not move the flaming window from its default position
- This bot reads the image wrong sometimes, but especially if its an INT stat the bot will have a real hard time
- As such, it may skip over a flame that meets the reqs just because it read the image wrong (this won't happen most of the time unless its INT)

# Stat Names (case sensitive)
Usable Stat Names: STR, DEX, LUK, RequiredLevel, Jump, AllStats, Defense, MagicAttack
(high chance of success)

Not Recommended Stat Names: INT, MaxHP, MaxMP, AttackPower, Speed
(image reading is not good for these)
